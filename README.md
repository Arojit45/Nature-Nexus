NatureNexus
NatureNexus is a modern, interactive web platform dedicated to wildlife protection and environmental conservation. It brings impactful solutions through a range of features designed to raise awareness and drive action. The platform includes an interactive Leaflet map that highlights biodiversity hotspots across India, color-coded to show the health of each region (critical – red, high priority – blue, healthy – green), along with a real-time reporting form for users to report wildlife threats. It also offers a wildlife adoption system, enabling users to support the care of endangered species. A live dashboard showcases key progress metrics such as the number of trees planted, wildlife rescued, habitats restored, and volunteers recruited—building transparency and trust. Lastly, the donation system allows people worldwide to contribute towards conservation efforts. These features collectively solve the problem of public unawareness, lack of direct engagement, and limited funding by offering education, real-time data, community participation, and global support for protecting wildlife and the environment.
